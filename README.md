# Godot Games

## [Matching](https://henryrlee.github.io/GodotGames/matching/)

Matching (连连看) is the first Godot game I developed.

The rule of the game is simple:

* Find two matching images that can be connected with no more than three
straight lines in cardinal directions
* Click on matching images to eliminate them
* The game finishes when you eliminate all the images

This game is a gift for my dear Catherine.
